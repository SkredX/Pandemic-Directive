# Pandemic Directive

Pandemic Directive is a browser based, choice driven simulation game that explores chaos theory and the butterfly effect through the lens of a global viral outbreak.

Small decisions made under uncertainty can cascade into irreversible global consequences. The game focuses on delayed effects, moral tradeoffs, and systemic collapse rather than binary good or bad choices.

The project is fully client side and can be hosted for free using GitHub Pages.

## Core Concept

You act as a crisis decision maker during the early days of a novel pandemic.  
You do not control outcomes directly.  
You influence a hidden world state that evolves over time.

Key ideas:
- Butterfly effect and nonlinear consequences
- Delayed causality
- Moral compromise under pressure
- Incomplete information
- Irreversibility of decisions

The same choice can lead to different outcomes depending on when and how it is made.

## Possible Endings

The game has multiple threshold based endings. None of them are reachable immediately.

- Human extinction
- Virus eradication at the cost of national collapse
- Controlled eradication with reduced casualties
- Long term generational damage to humanity

Endings are determined by accumulated world state, not by scripted branches.

## Technology Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic
- HTML for structure
- CSS for terminal style presentation
- GitHub Pages for hosting

There is no backend, no server, and no external dependencies.

## Design Philosophy

- Choices modify systems, not outcomes
- Consequences may appear long after the choice is made
- Silence is used as feedback
- Numbers are hidden to emphasize uncertainty
- The player is not a hero

This project intentionally avoids gamification mechanics such as scores, rewards, or optimal paths.
